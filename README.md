# RPAL-Interpreter Group-69

### How to run
- First execute Makefile.
- Put all RPAL test programs in the root directory. We had added the sample_test.txt to the root directory, which contains the sample input program of the Project_Requirements document.
  - Run `$ java myrpal <file_name>` for running the file which contains any RPAL programs and ***print only the Output***.
  - Run `$ java myrpal -ast <file_name>` for running the file and ***print AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) without the Output***.
